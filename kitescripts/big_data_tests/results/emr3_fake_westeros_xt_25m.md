LynxKite big data test results
==============================

This file is generated by [test_big_data.sh](https://github.com/biggraph/biggraph/blob/master/test_big_data.sh).

To update this file, run `test_big_data.sh '*' 'fake_westeros_xt_25m' 3`.

You can also simply comment _"Big Data Test please"_ on any pull request. That will trigger
running the big data tests with the default parameters of `test_big_data.sh`. Once that's done,
a change for the corresponding `last_results_...` file will be pushed to the pull request by
Jenkins.

The results of the latest run are below:
