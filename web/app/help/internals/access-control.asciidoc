## User authentication & access control

User authentication is an optional feature and can be turned on or off depending on the
deployment. If user authentication is enabled LynxKite data can only be accessed after
authentication. The _logout_ link is only displayed at the bottom right if authentication
is enabled.

### Access control lists

Access rights are controlled at two levels: the folder level
and the file prefix level. The latter is only relevant to administrators
and described in the Admin Manual; the first is described below.

A folder has two access control lists: one for reading
and one for writing. A user has read
access to a folder if they are on its access control list and have read
access to the parent folders recursively. Similarly, write access requires being on the
write access control list plus read access for all parents. Being on the write access
control list implies being on the read access list on every local level.

- The users with read access to a folder can view its contents.
- The users with write access to a folder can create, delete and rename workspaces, snapshots and
subfolders, see every workspace and snapshot, and perform any changes (including modifying the writing list). Note that renaming requires write access on both the original and the
target folder if those two are different. Similarly, copying (duplicating) a workspace or
a folder requires write access to the target folder.

The access control lists can be modified in the folder settings
+++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></i></label>+++.
The lists are comma-delimited and `+*+` (asterisk) can be used as a wildcard. `+*+`
means all logged in users. `+*@lynxanalytics.com+`, for example, means all users with
user names matching that pattern.

When creating a folder, you have the choice of setting it to _private_,
_publicly readable_ or _publicly writable_. These options provide different default
access control lists, but the lists can be freely modified later.

If a user has no read access to a folder, they will not show up for them
in the folder list.

If a user has read-only access to a folder, they can always create copies of the
workspaces and make changes to the copies.

To protect your workspaces from other users you have to put it in a folder writable only
by you.

### Administrator users

Administrator users have special privileges:

- Administrators can read and write all folders, regardless of the access
control lists. They can also change these access control lists.
- Administrators can create new users, including new administrators. The users are
managed through the `/users` page.

### Home folder

A home folder is created for every user automatically. This folder has read and
write access only by that user by default.
