## Prefixed paths

LynxKite provides read and write access to distributed file systems for the purpose of importing
and exporting data. To make this access secure and convenient, paths are specified relative
to _prefixes_.

Prefixes are configured during LynxKite deployment through the `prefix_definitions.txt` file.

For example, let's say we want to import a file on Amazon S3. The file is in bucket `my-company`,
at `data/file.csv`. The full Hadoop path to this file would be:

 s3n://<key id>:<secret key>@my-company/data/file.csv

During deployment, the `COMPANY_S3` prefix has been configured:

 COMPANY_S3="s3n://<key id>:<secret key>@my-company/"

In this case the file can be referenced for the import operation as:

 COMPANY_S3$/data/file.csv

This scheme has a number of benefits:

- The user has to type less.
- The credentials can remain secret from all users.
- The credentials can be changed at a single location and it will be applied to all file operations.
- The root directory can be relocated without affecting users.
