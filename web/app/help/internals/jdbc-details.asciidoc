## Database connections

LynxKite can connect to databases via JDBC. JDBC is a widely adopted database connection interface
and all major databases support it.

### Installation

To be able to connect to a database LynxKite requires the JDBC drivers for the database to be
installed. LynxKite comes with the JDBC drivers for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite pre-installed.
For accessing other databases you will need to acquire the driver from the vendor. The driver is a
`jar` file. You have to add the full path of the `jar` file to `KITE_EXTRA_JARS` in `.kiterc` and
restart LynxKite.

### Usage

The database for import/export operations is specified via a connection URL. The driver is
responsible for interpreting the connection URL. Please consult the documentation for the JDBC
driver for the connection URL syntax.

If you are in a controlled network environment, make sure that the LynxKite application and all the
Spark executors are allowed to connect to the database server.
