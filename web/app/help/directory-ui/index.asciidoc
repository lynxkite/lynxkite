# Project browser

The project browser is the interface that welcomes you when you navigate to LynxKite in a browser.
Like a file browser, it makes it possible to navigate a folder structure and delete or move
items. It also allows creating new folders, projects, and tables -- commonly referred to as entries.

To make navigation easier the project browser remembers the last folder that was open.
