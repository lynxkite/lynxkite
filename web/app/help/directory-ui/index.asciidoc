# Workspace browser

The workspace browser is the interface that welcomes you when you navigate to LynxKite in a browser.
Like a file browser, it makes it possible to navigate a folder structure and delete or move
items. It also allows creating new folders and workspaces -- commonly referred to as entries.

To make navigation easier the workspace browser remembers the last folder that was open.
