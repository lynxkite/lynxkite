## Folders

Folders make it possible to keep the workspaces and other items in LynxKite organized. A common way to
group the items is by user: so the workspaces and snaphots of one user would be in a separate folder from the
workspaces and snapshots of another. This organization is encouraged by assigning a private folder to each user
inside the `Users` folder.

Click +++<span class="icon glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span>+++ _New folder_
to create a new folder inside the current folder.

Access the dropdown menu for a folder in the workspace browser
(+++<a href class="btn-dropdown dropdown-toggle"><span class="caret"></span></a>+++)
to discard, duplicate, or rename the folder. The rename command also makes it possible to move the
folder to a different path.
