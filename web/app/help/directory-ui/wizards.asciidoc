## Wizards

Wizards are dedicated tools that distill complex analysis workflows into a series of
simple steps. See <<Authoring wizards>> to learn how they are created.

Wizards appear in the workspace browser with the
+++<span class="icon glyphicon glyphicon-gift"></span>+++ icon.

If you click a wizard, a copy will be created in your user directory.
This copy is marked as _in-progress_ and its icon changes to
+++<span class="icon glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span>+++.
When you click an in-progress wizard, it opens normally and you can
continue where you left off.

If you want to edit the workspace behind the wizard, open the dropdown menu
in the workspace browser
(+++<a href class="btn-dropdown dropdown-toggle" dropdown-toggle><span class="caret"></span></a>+++)
and choose the _Open workspace_ option.

You can also access the workspace of an in-progress wizard by opening the wizard and
clicking the _View workspace_ / _Fine tune in workspace_ button

After opening a wizard, you can fill out the parameters for each step.
Click on a heading to move to that step. You can move back or forward as much as you like.
Your changes are captured in your _"In progress wizards"_ directory.

Steps with visualizations or large parameter lists benefit from a full-screen view.
Click the +++<span class="icon fas fa-expand"></span>+++ icon on the current step to switch
to maximized view. Click the +++<span class="icon fas fa-compress"></span>+++ icon to
return to the sequential view.
