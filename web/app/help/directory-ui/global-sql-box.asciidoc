## SQL for snapshots

There is a SQL interface on the workspace browser page that can be expanded by clicking on the plus
button. It can be used to make queries to all available snapshots in the current folder,
those in subfolders included. To refer to the table you want to access, you first need to
provide the path from your current folder to the snapshot, then in case of graph snapshots
use `.` to specify the table you want to access. The table reference must be enclosed between two
`{backtick}` characters (_see example below_).

For example, let's say you are in your private folder where you have a subfolder called
`Premier_League`, in which you have a graph snapshot named `Arsenal`. If you want to access the
vertices table of the Arsenal graph snapshot from your private folder, you need to refer to it by
`{backtick}Premier_League/Arsenal.vertices{backtick}`. In case you are already in the
`Premier_League` folder, the reference shortens to `{backtick}Arsenal.vertices{backtick}`

The SQL interface on the workspace browser page can also be used to reference table snapshots.
For example, let's say you have a table snapshot called `Players` which has the data of all
football players playing in the Premier League. Then you can reference it the same way as the
tables in graph snapshots: e.g. you can list all Arsenal players with `select * from
{backtick}Players{backtick} where team = "Arsenal"`. Notice that you still need to enclose the
name of the snapshot between two `{backtick}` symbols.

For details about querying graph snapshots, see the documentation for the <<sql1>> box.

### The table browser

The table browser helps to find available table and column names for the global SQL box or for
SQL boxes in the workspace. The following hints help with usage:

* Drag table and column names into the editor box with your mouse.
* Double click on names works too with the global SQL editor.
* Click on the icon to expand a directory, a snapshot or a table.

### Exporting results

The first few rows of query results can be inspected in the browser. The full results can be
exported into files. LynxKite provides a range of export formats. For details about the available
formats, see the documentation of the <<export-to-csv>>, <<export-to-jdbc>>, <<export-to-json>>,
<<export-to-orc>>, and <<export-to-parquet>> operations.
