# Graph visualizations

You can create graph visualizations by adding the operation <<Graph visualization>> to your workflows or by clicking on the _"Visualize"_ button in the <<State popups>>.

There are multiple types of graph visualizations, but in every case you see some objects connected by some arcs. You can choose to open the <<Concrete vertices view>> or the <<Bucketed view>>.

Visualized objects can represent vertices or groups of vertices of the graph.
The same way arcs on the screen might represent multiple edges in the graph.
E.g. if there are multiple parallel edges A{to}B it will still be represented by a single visualized
arc. Also, when we display groups of vertices then a single arc going from one group to another
represents all the edges in the graph going from one group to the other.

You can visualize graph attributes in various ways, see details in section
<<Concrete visualization options>>.

Regardless of the visualization mode you can do the same basic adjustments on the visualization
screen:

Zooming in/out::
Use your mouse wheel or scroll gesture to zoom in and out. Left double-click and right
double-click can also be used for this.

Panning::
Hold down your left mouse button anywhere on the visualization screen and drag the graph around.

Zooming objects in/out::
Hold down the Shift button while zooming in and out to only change the size of objects
(vertices, edges).
