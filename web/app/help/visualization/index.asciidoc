# Graph visualizations

When some kind of visualization is turned on, a visualization screen opens above the
<<project-header>>.

There are multiple types of visualizations, but in every case you see some objects connected by
some arcs.

Visualized objects can represent vertices or groups of vertices of the graph.
The same way arcs on the screen might represent multiple edges in the graph.
E.g. if there are multiple parallel edges A{to}B it will still be represented by a single visualized
arc. Also, when we display groups of vertices then a single arc going from one group to another
represents all the edges in the graph going from one group to the other.

You can visualize graph attributes in various ways, see details in section
<<Concrete visualization options>>.

Regardless of the visualization mode you can do the same basic adjustments on the visualization
screen:

Zooming in/out::
Use your mouse wheel or scroll gesture to zoom in and out. Left double-click and right
double-click can also be used for this.

Panning::
Hold down your left mouse button anywhere on the visualizaton screen and drag the graph around.

Zooming objects in/out::
Hold down the Shift button while zooming in and out to only change the size of objects
(vertices, edges).
