## Bucketed view

Shows a consolidated view of all the vertices of the graph. Vertices can be grouped by up to two
attributes and the system visualizes the sizes of the groups and the amount of edges going among
the groups.

To add a vertex attribute to the visualization, click the attribute and pick _"Visualize as"_ _X_ or
_Y_.

For `String` attributes, the created buckets will correspond to the possible values of the
attribute.
If the attribute has more possible values than the number of buckets selected by the user then the
program will show buckets for the most frequent values and creates an extra `Other` bucket for the
rest.

For `number` attributes buckets will correspond to intervals. We split the interval `[min, max]`
(where `min` and `max` are the minimum and maximum values of the attribute respectively)
into subintervals of the same length. E.g. we might end up with buckets `[0, 10)`,
`[10, 20)`, `[20, 30]`.

If _logarithmic mode_ is selected for the attribute then the subintervals are
selected so that they have the same length on the logarithmic scale. E.g. a possible
bucketing is `[1, 2)`, `[2, 4)`, `[4, 8]`. In logarithmic mode, if the attribute has any
non-positive values, then an extra bucket will be created which will contain all non-positive values.

Edge attributes can also be added to the visualization to be used for calculating the width of the
aggregate edges.

By default the visualization has 4&times;4 buckets, but this can be adjusted in the visualization
settings list.

### Relative edge density

Bucketed view by default comes in _absolute edge density_ mode. Absolute edge density means the
thickness of an edge going from bucket A to bucket B corresponds to the number of edges going from a
vertex in bucket A to a vertex in bucket B (or in the weighted case: to the sum of the weights on
such edges). This makes the edges going between large buckets typically much thicker than those
going between smaller buckets.

_Relative edge density_, on the other hand, is calculated by dividing the number of edges between
bucket A and bucket B by [size of bucket A] &times; [size of bucket B]. This way, the individual
bucket sizes aren't reflected on the thickness of the edges.

### Precise and approximate counts

For very large graphs the bucketed view numbers are extrapolated from a sample. Precise calculation
would not produce a visible change in the visualization, so most often it is not necessary. It can
be desirable however if the numbers from the visualization are to be used in a report.

Click the _"approximate counts"_ option to switch it to _"precise counts"_.
