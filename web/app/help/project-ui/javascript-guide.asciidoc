## JavaScript guide

You can derive attributes in LynxKite by implementing the derivation formulas using JavaScript. For a
general introduction to the JavaScript language, see:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript

### Getting started

The simplest way of using JavaScript to derive attributes is to just provide a one-liner expression
in <<derived-vertex-attribute>> or <<derived-edge-attribute>>. The examples below are for deriving
vertex attributes. The only difference from deriving edge attributes is the way vertex attributes can be
accessed.

A simple example:
```
6 * 7
```
will generate a constant Double attribute of value `42.0`. You can also use values of other attributes
in the expression:
```
6 * age
```
assuming that there is already an `age` attribute defined. LynxKite can also accept a list of
JavaScript expressions:
```
var x = age + 1.0;
var y = num_friends + 2.0;
y / x;
```
In this case, the value of the last expression will be taken as the value of the derived attribute.
More complex code can be structured using functions:
```
function getAge() {
  return age + 1.0;
}
function getNumFriends() {
  return num_friends + 2.0;
}
getNumFriends() / getAge();
```

### Available utilities

In addition to the standard JavaScript libraries, LynxKite provides a few utilities of
its own.

#### `util.hash(object)`

Computes a 32 bit hash value of the given object.

#### `util.rnd(seed)`

The JavaScript `Math.random()` function does not work well with LynxKite: its seed
cannot be specified by the user, and therefore its result is not repeatable.

To mitigate this, LynxKite offers the function `util.rnd(seed)`, which returns a
random number generator starting with the specified seed. This method can be useful
if you need to generate more than one random number per graph node. (Otherwise
you can just derive from <<add-random-edge-attribute>> or <<add-random-vertex-attribute>>.)

Usage example:
```
var hash = util.hash(randomSeedAttr);
var rand = util.rnd(hash);
var coinToss1 = rand.nextBoolean() ? 'H' : 'T';
var coinToss2 = rand.nextBoolean() ? 'H' : 'T';
var coinToss3 = rand.nextBoolean() ? 'H' : 'T';
coinToss1 + coinToss2 + coinToss3;
```
This example assumes that there is already an attribute named `randomSeedAttr`,
which we are using as the random seed. The result in this example will be a String
attribute.

The available methods are listed here:

### Types and conversions

LynxKite uses Scala data types internally. These are automatically converted to and from corresponding
JavaScript types. Each below list item has the form of Scala type &harr; corresponding
JavaScript type:

* Boolean &harr; boolean
* Byte &harr; number
* Short &harr; number
* Int &harr; number
* Float &harr; number
* Double &harr; number
* Char &harr; string
* String &harr; string
* Iterable collection containing instances of the below Scala types &harr; JavaScript array
containing the converted instances:
** Boolean, Short,  Int, Float, Double, Char, String

Values of other types need to be manually converted before passing to or from JavaScript. In
particular, long numeric types need these conversions. You can use for example one of
the following operations to achieve that:
<<vertex-attribute-to-string>> or <<vertex-attribute-to-double>>.
Converting to Double will of course cause precision loss for large numbers, but
converting to String will not.

### JavaScript engine

LynxKite is using Mozilla Rhino version 1.7.7 as its JavaScript engine.
