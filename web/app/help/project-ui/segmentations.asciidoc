## Segmentations

The segmentation of a graph is another graph.
The vertices of the segmentation are also called "segments".
A set of edges exists between the base graph and its segmentation, representing membership
in a segment. (To distinguish these special edges we also call them "links".)

For example the <<find-maximal-cliques>> operation creates a new segmentation, in which each segment
represents a clique in the base graph. Vertices of the base graph are linked to the segments
which represent cliques that they belong to.

Segmentations serve as the foundation of many advanced operations. For example the average age
for each clique can be calculated using the <<aggregate-to-segmentation>> operation and the
average size of the cliques that a person belongs to can be calculated with
<<aggregate-from-segmentation>>.

Segmentations can be opened on the right hand side by clicking them and choosing _"Open"_ in the
menu. They can be visualized the usual way. The links are displayed when both the base graph
and its segmentation are visualized. This works when both sides are visualized as bucketed graphs,
when they are visualized as concrete vertices, or even when one side is bucketed and the other is
concrete. This can be used to gain unique insights about the structure of relationships in the
graph.

Segmentations act much like the base graph, and you can even import existing graphs to act as
segmentations. (In this case it is possible that the links will represent a relationship other
than membership.)
