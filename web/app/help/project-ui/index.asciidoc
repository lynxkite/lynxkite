# Graph box outputs

A graph box output is a rich box output type that represents the base graph and its segmentations
in one bundle. The <<state-popups,state popup>> for a graph output shows basic information about the base graph,
such as the number of vertices and edges. It lists the scalars, attributes, and segmentations.
Scalar values are displayed, attribute histograms are available on click, and segmentations can be
opened to dig deeper.

A remark to avoid some confusion: we usually use the word _graph_ for graph box outputs
and also for referring to the base graph.
