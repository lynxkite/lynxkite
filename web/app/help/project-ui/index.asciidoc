# Graphs

We use the word graph for a rich box output type that represents the base graph
and its segmentations in one bundle. The <<state-popups,state popup>> for a graph
shows basic information about the base graph, such as the number of vertices and edges.
It lists the attributes and segmentations. Graph attribute values are displayed,
attribute histograms are available on click, and segmentations can be opened to
dig deeper.
