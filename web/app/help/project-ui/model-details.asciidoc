## Machine learning models

Machine learning models are stored as graph attributes.
They are created by a machine learning operation (for example <<train-linear-regression-model>>)
and used for prediction with the <<predict-with-model>> operation or for classification with the
<<classify-with-model>> operation.

### Method

The machine learning algorithm used to create this model.

### Label

The name of the attribute that this model is trained to predict. (The dependent variable.)

This will not appear for unsupervised machine learning models.

### Scaling

Details about the pre-processing scaling step applied to the features before training. The two
phases are centering and scaling. The first phase (centering) centers the data with mean before scaling,
i.e., the mean is subtracted from all elements. The data set acquired this way has a mean of 0.
The second phase (scaling) is acquired by dividing all the elements by the standard deviation.
The means and deviations in these steps are computed columnwise.

Suppose we have an original data item (a, b). After these two steps, the data item that
is used for the training will be ((a-m1)/d1, (b-m2)/d2), where m1 and d1 are the mean
and the standard deviation for the first column (the a's) and m2 and d2 are the mean
and the standard deviation for the second column (the b's).

Note that both steps are optional: it depends on the model, whether they are applied or not.

### Features

The list of the feature attributes that this model uses for predictions.
(The independent variables.)

### Details

For decision tree classification model:

* The i-th element of `support` is the number of occurrences of the i-th class
in the training data divided by the size of the training data.

For linear regression and logistic regression models:

* `intercept` is the constant parameter in the regression equation of the model.
* `coefficients` are the coefficients in the regression equation of the model.

For linear regression model:

* `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination[R-squared]` is the coefficient of
determination, an index of the linear correlation between the features and the label.
* `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error[MAPE]` is the mean absolute percentage
error, a measure of prediction accuracy.
* `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-statistic[T-values]` can be used for the hypothesis test of coefficient
 significances. This will not appear for the lasso model.

For logistic regression model:

* `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test[Z-values]` can be used for the hypothesis test of coefficient
significances.
* `http://statistics.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/Psuedo_RSquareds.htm[pseudo R-squared]`, or McFadden's
R-squared in our case, is an index of the logistic correlation between the features and the label.
* `threshold` is the probability threshold for binary classification. If the outcome probability of the label
1.0 is greater than the threshold, the model will predict the classification label as 1.0. The threshold is
obtained by maximizing the F-score.
* `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score[F-score]` is a measure of test accuracy for binary classifications.

For KMeans clustering model:

* `cluster centers` are the vectors of the KMeans cluster centers.
* `cost` is the k-means cost (sum of squared distances of points to their nearest center) for this model on
the training data.
