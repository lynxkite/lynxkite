### Pull segmentation one level up

Creates a copy of a segmentation in the parent of its parent segmentation.
In the created segmentation, the set of segments will be the same as in the
original. A vertex will be made member of a segment if it was transitively
member of the corresponding segment in the original segmentation. The attributes
and sub-segmentations of the segmentation are also copied.
