### Segment by numeric attribute

Segments the vertices by a `number` vertex attribute.

The domain of the attribute is split into intervals of the given size and every vertex that
belongs to a given interval will belong to one segment. Empty segments are not created.

====
[p-name]#Segmentation name#::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[p-attr]#Attribute#::
The `number` attribute to segment by.

[p-interval_size]#Interval size#::
The attribute's domain will be split into intervals of this size. The splitting always starts at
zero.

[p-overlap]#Overlap#::
If you enable overlapping intervals, then each interval will have a 50% overlap
with both the previous and the next interval. As a result each vertex will belong
to two segments, guaranteeing that any vertices with an attribute value difference
less than half the interval size will share at least one segment.
