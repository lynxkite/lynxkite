### Segment by Double attribute

Segments the vertices by a `Double` vertex attribute.

The domain of the attribute is split into intervals of the given size and every vertex that
belongs to a given interval will belong to one segment. Empty segments are not created.

====
[[name]] Segmentation name::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[[attr]] Attribute::
The `Double` attribute to segment by.

[[interval_size]] Interval size::
The attribute's domain will be split into intervals of this size. The splitting always starts at
zero.

[[overlap]] Overlap::
If you enable overlapping intervals, then each interval will have a 50% overlap
with both the previous and the next interval. As a result each vertex will belong
to two segments, guaranteeing that any vertices with an attribute value difference
less than half the interval size will share at least one segment.
