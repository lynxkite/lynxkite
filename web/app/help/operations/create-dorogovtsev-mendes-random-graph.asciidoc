### Create Dorogovtsevâ€“Mendes random graph

Creates a planar random graph with a power-law distribution. Starts with a triangle and in each
step adds a new node that is connected to the two endpoints of a randomly selected edge.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0206467[Modern architecture of random graphs: Constructions and correlations] by Dorogovtsev et al.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1DorogovtsevMendesGenerator.html[NetworKit] implementation.

====
