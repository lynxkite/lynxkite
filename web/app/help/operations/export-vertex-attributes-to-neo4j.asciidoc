### Export vertex attributes to Neo4j

Exports vertex attributes from a graph in LynxKite to a
corresponding graph in https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j].

The nodes in Neo4j are identified by a key property (or properties).
You must have a corresponding vertex attribute in LynxKite by the same name.
This will be used to find the right nodes to update in Neo4j.

The properties of the Neo4j nodes will be updated with the exported vertex attributes using
a Cypher query like this:

    UNWIND $events as event
    MATCH (n:Label1:Label2 {`key`: event.`key`})
    SET n += event

In the event of duplicate keys on either end this will update the properties of all the matching
Neo4j nodes with the values from the last matching LynxKite vertex.

====

[p-url]#Neo4j connection#::
The Neo4j connection string of the form `bolt://localhost:7687`.

[p-username]#Neo4j username#::
Username for the connection.

[p-password]#Neo4j password#::
Password for the connection. It will be saved in the workspace and visible to anyone with
access to the workspace.

[p-version]#Export repetition ID#::
LynxKite only re-computes outputs if parameters or inputs have changed.
This is true for exports too. If you want to repeat a previous export, you can increase this
export repetition ID parameter.

[p-labels]#Node labels#::
Makes it possible to restrict the export to one label (or combination of labels) in Neo4j.
This is useful to make sure no other node type is accidentally affected.
The format is as in Cypher: `:Label1:Label2`. Leave empty to allow updating any node.

[p-keys]#Attribute(s) to use as key#::
Select the attribute (or attributes) to identify the Neo4j nodes by.
The attribute name must match the property name in Neo4j.
