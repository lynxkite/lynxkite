### Set segmentation icon

Associates an icon with a segmentation. It has no effect beyond highlighting something on the user
interface.

The icons are a subset of the Unicode characters in the "emoji" range, as provided by the
https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/[Google Noto Font].

This operation is more easily accessed from the segmentation's dropdown menu in the graph state view.

====
[p-name]#Segmentation#::
The segmentation to highlight.

[p-icon]#Icon#::
One of the supported icon names, such as `snowman_without_snow`. Leave empty to _remove_ the icon.
