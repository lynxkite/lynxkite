### Check cliques

Validates that the segments of the segmentation are in fact cliques.

Creates a new `invalid_cliques` graph attribute, which lists non-clique segment IDs up to a certain number.

====
[p-selected]#Segment IDs to check#::
The validation can be restricted to a subset of the segments, resulting in quicker operation.

[p-bothdir]#Edges required in both directions#::
Whether edges have to exist in both directions between all members of a clique.
