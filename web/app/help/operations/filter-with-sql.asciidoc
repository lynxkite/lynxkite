### Filter with SQL

Filters a graph or table with SQL expressions.

This has the same effect as using a SQL box with
``select * from vertices where <FILTER>`` and ``select * from edge_attributes where <FILTER>``
and then recombining the tables into a graph. But it is more efficient.

When used with a table input it is identical to a SQL box with
``select * from input where <FILTER>``. But it saves a bit of typing.

====
[p-vertex_filter]#Vertex filter#::
Filter the vertices with this SQL expression when the input is a graph.
For example you could write ``age > 30 and income < age * 2000``.

[p-edge_filter]#Edge filter#::
Filter the edges with this SQL expression when the input is a graph.
For example you could write ``duration > count * 10 or kind like '%_message_%'``.

[p-filter]#Filter#::
Filter with this SQL expression when the input is a table.
For example you could write ``age > 30 and income < age * 2000``.
