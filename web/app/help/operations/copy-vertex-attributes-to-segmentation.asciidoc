### Copy vertex attributes to segmentation

Copies all vertex attributes from the parent to the segmentation.

This operation available only when each segment contains just one vertex.

====
*Example use case*

You have performed <<link-graph-and-segmentation-by-fingerprint>>. At this point there is
a sparse one-to-one connection between the base graph vertices and the segmentation vertices.
You can use <<copy-vertex-attributes-from-segmentation>> and
<<copy-vertex-attributes-to-segmentation>> to copy all attributes from one side to the other.

*Parameters*

[p-prefix]#Attribute name prefix#::
A prefix for the new attribute names. Leave empty for no prefix.
