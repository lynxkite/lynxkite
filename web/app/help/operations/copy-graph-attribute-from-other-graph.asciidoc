### Copy graph attribute from other graph

This operation can take a graph attribute from another graph and copy it
to the current graph.

It can be useful if we trained a machine learning model in one graph, and would like
to apply this model in another graph for predicting undefined attribute values.

====
[p-sourceproject]#Other graph's name#::
The name of the other graph from where we want to copy a graph attribute.

[p-sourcescalarname]#Name of the graph attribute in the other graph#::
The name of the graph attribute in the other graph. If it is a simple string, then
the graph attribute with that name has to be in the root of the other graph. If it is
a `.`-separated string, then it means a graph attribute in a segmentation of the other graph.
The syntax for this case is: `seg_1.seg_2.....seg_n.graph_attribute`.

[p-destscalarname]#Name for the graph attribute in this graph#::
This will be the name of the copied graph attribute in this graph.
