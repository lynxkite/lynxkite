### Add rank attribute

Creates a new vertex attribute that is the _rank_ of the vertex when ordered by the key
attribute. Rank 0 will be the vertex with the highest or lowest key attribute value
(depending on the direction of the ordering). `String` attributes will be ranked
alphabetically.

This operation makes it easy to find the top (or bottom) N vertices by an attribute.
First, create the ranking attribute. Then filter by this attribute.

====
[[rankattr]] Rank attribute name::
The new attribute will be created under this name.

[[keyattr]] Key attribute name::
The attribute to rank by.

[[order]] Order::
With _ascending_ ordering rank 0 belongs to the vertex with the minimal key attribute value or
the vertex that is at the beginning of the alphabet.
With _descending_ ordering rank 0 belongs to the vertex with the maximal key attribute value or
the vertex that is at the end of the alphabet.
