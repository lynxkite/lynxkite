### Segment by geographical proximity

Creates a segmentation from the features in a Shapefile. A vertex is connected to a segment if the
the `position` vertex attribute is within a specified distance from the segment's geometry
attribute. Feature attributes from the Shapefile become segmentation attributes.

* The lookup depends on the coordinate reference system and distance metric of the feature. All
  inputs must use the same coordinate reference system and distance metric.
* This algorithm creates an overlapping segmentation since one vertex can be sufficiently close to
  multiple GEO segments.

Shapefiles can be obtained from various sources, like
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Shapefiles[OpenStreetMap].

*Parameters*

[p-name]#Name#::
The name of the new geographical segmentation.

[p-position]#Position#::
The (latitude, longitude) location tuple.

[p-shapefile]#Shapefile#::
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile[Shapefile] used for the lookup. The list is created from
the files in the `KITE_META/resources/shapefiles` directory. A Shapefile consist of a `.shp`, `.shx`
and `.dbf` file of the same name.

[p-distance]#Distance#::
Vertices are connected to geographical segments if within this distance. The distance has to use
the same metric and coordinate reference system as the features within the Shapefile.

[p-ignoreUnsupportedShapes]#Ignore unsupported shape types#::
If set `true`, silently ignores unknown shape types potentially contained by the Shapefile.
Otherwise throws an error.
