### Use base graph as segmentation

Creates a new segmentation which is a copy of the base graph. Also creates segmentation links
between the original vertices and their corresponding vertices in the segmentation.

For example, let's say we have a social network and we want to make a segmentation containing a
selected group of people and the segmentation links should represent the original connections
between the members of this selected group and other people.

We can do this by first using this operation to copy the base graph to segmentation then using
the <<Grow segmentation>> operation to add the necessary segmentation links. Finally, using the
<<Filter by attributes>> operation, we can ensure that the segmentation contains only members of
the selected group.

[p-name]#Segmentation name#::
The name assigned to the new segmentation. It defaults to the graph's name.
