### Compute diameter

The diameter of a graph is the maximal shortest-distance path length
between two vertices. All vertex pairs are at most this far from each
other.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1Diameter.html[NetworKit]
implementation.

[p-max_error]#Maximum relative error#::
Set to 0 to get the exact diameter. This may require a lot of computation, however.
+
Set to a value greater than 0 to use a faster computation that gives lower and
upper bounds on the diameter. With 0.1 maximum relative error, for example, the
upper bound will be no more than 10% greater than the true diameter.
