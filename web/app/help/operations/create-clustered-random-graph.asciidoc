### Create clustered random graph

Creates a random graph with a given number of clusters.
It randomly places each vertex into one of the clusters then adds an edge for each
vertex pair with the given probabilities.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1ClusteredRandomGraphGenerator.html[NetworKit] implementation.

====
[p-size]#Number of vertices#::
The created graph will have this many vertices.

[p-clusters]#Number of clusters#::
The created graph will have this many clusters.
Each vertex will be randomly placed into one of the clusters with equal probability.

[p-probability_in]#Intra-cluster edge probability#::
The probablity for adding an edge between two vertices if they are in the same cluster.

[p-probability_out]#Inter-cluster edge probability#::
The probablity for adding an edge between two vertices if they are in different clusters.

[p-seed]#Seed#::
The random seed.
