### Merge parallel segmentation links

Multiple segmentation links going from A base vertex to B segmentation vertex
will be merged into a single link.

After performing a <<merge-vertices-by-attribute, Merge vertices by attribute>> operation, there might
be multiple parallel links going between some of the base graph and segmentation vertices.
This can cause unexpected behavior when aggregating to or from the segmentation.
This operation addresses this behavior by merging parallel segmentation links.
