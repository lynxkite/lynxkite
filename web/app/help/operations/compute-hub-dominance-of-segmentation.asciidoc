### Compute hub dominance of segmentation

Computes a scalar for a non-overlapping segmentation.
The hub dominance of a segment is the highest internal degree in the segment
divided by the highest _possible_ internal degree. (The segment size minus one.)
The hub dominance of a segmentation is the average across all segmentations.

If most segments have a well-connected hub, this metric will be close to 1.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1HubDominance.html[NetworKit]
implementation.
