### Import Parquet

https://parquet.apache.org/[Apache Parquet] is a columnar data storage format.

====
[p-filename]#File#::
The distributed file-system path of the file. See <<prefixed-paths>> for more details on specifying
paths.

include::{g}[tag=import-box]

[p-eager]#Import now or provide schema#::
Importing data into LynxKite normally means reading the source data and writing it to
LynxKite's storage directory as a Parquet file. The "Import now" option does this.
+
When the source data is already a Parquet file, you have the option to avoid copying
the data to LynxKite. In this case the schema has to be provided explicitly, so
that you can work with the table even before LynxKite first touches it.

[p-schema]#Schema#::
A semi-colon separated list of column names and types. The types are to be specified
using Apache Spark's syntax. For example: `col1: string; col2: int; col3: decimal(8, 2)`.
