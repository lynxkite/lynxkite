### Custom plot

Creates a plot from the input table. The plot can be defined using the
https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/[Vega-Lite] JSON API.

The `data` field in the Vega-Lite specification will be automatically filled in
by LynxKite, giving you access to the input table. (Limited to 10,000 rows.)

LynxKite comes with several <<built-ins>>, many of them based on the Custom plot box. You can dive
into these custom boxes to see the code used to build them.
