### Split vertices

Split (multiply) vertices in a graph. A numeric vertex attribute controls how many
copies of the vertex should exist after the operation. If this attribute is
1, the vertex will be kept as it is. If this attribute is zero, the vertex
will be discarded entirely. Higher values (e.g., 2) will result in
more identical copies of the given vertex.
All edges coming from and going to this vertex are
multiplied (or discarded) appropriately.

After the operation, all previous vertex and edge attributes will be preserved;
in particular, copies of one vertex will have the same values for the previous vertex
attributes. A new vertex attribute (the so called index attribute) will also be
created so that you can differentiate between copies of the same vertex.
If a given vertex was multiplied by n times, the n new vertices will have n different
index attribute values running from 0 to n-1.

This operation assigns new vertex ids to the vertices; these will be accessible
via a new vertex attribute.

====
[p-rep]#Repetition attribute#::
A numberic vertex attribute that specifies how many copies of the vertex should
exist after the operation.
(The number value is rounded to the nearest integer, so 1.8 will mean 2 copies.)

[p-idx]#Index attribute name#::
The name of the attribute that will contain unique identifiers for the otherwise
identical copies of the vertex.
