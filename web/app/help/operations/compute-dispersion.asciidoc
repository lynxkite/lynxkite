### Compute dispersion

Calculates the extent to which two people's mutual friends are not themselves well-connected.
The dispersion attribute for an A{to}B edge is the number of pairs of nodes that are both
connected to A and B but are not directly connected to each other.

Dispersion ignores edge directions.

It is a useful signal for identifying romantic partnerships -- connections with high dispersion --
according to http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6753[
  _Romantic Partnerships and the Dispersion of Social Ties:
  A Network Analysis of Relationship Status on Facebook_].

A normalized dispersion metric is also generated by this operation. This is normalized against the
embeddedness of the edge with the formula recommended in the cited article.
(_disp(u,v)^0.61^/(emb(u,v)+5)_) It does not necessarily fall in the _(0,1)_ range.
