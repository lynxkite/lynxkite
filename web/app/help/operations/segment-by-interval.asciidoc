### Segment by interval

Segments the vertices by a pair of `number` vertex attributes representing intervals.

The domain of the attributes is split into intervals of the given size. Each of these
intervals will represent a segment. Each vertex will belong to each segment whose
interval intersects with the interval of the vertex. Empty segments are not created.

[p-name]#segmentation name#::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[p-begin_attr]#Begin attribute#::
The `number` attribute corresponding the beginning of intervals to segment by.

[p-end_attr]#End attribute#::
The `number` attribute corresponding the end of intervals to segment by.

[p-interval_size]#interval size#::
The attribute's domain will be split into intervals of this size. The splitting always starts at
zero.

[p-overlap]#overlap#::
If you enable overlapping intervals, then each interval will have a 50% overlap
with both the previous and the next interval.
