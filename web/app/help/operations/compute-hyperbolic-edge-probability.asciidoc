### Compute hyperbolic edge probability
<<experimental-operation,+++<i class="fa fa-warning"></i>+++ *Warning! Experimental operation.*>>

Adds edge attribute _hyperbolic edge probability_ based on
hyperbolic distances between vertices. This indicates
how likely that edge would be to exist if the input graph was
probability x similarity-grown.
On a general level it is a metric of *edge strength*.
Probabilities are guaranteed to be 0 =< p =< 1 .
Vertices must have two _number_ vertex attributes to be
used as radial and angular coordinates.
The algorithm is based on
https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4384[Network Mapping by Replaying Hyperbolic Growth].

====
[p-radial]#Radial#::
The vertex attribute to be used as radial coordinates.
Should not contain negative values.

[p-angular]#Angular#::
The vertex attribute to be used as angular coordinates.
Values should be 0 - 2 * Pi.
