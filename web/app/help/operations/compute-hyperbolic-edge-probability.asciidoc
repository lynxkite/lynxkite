### Compute hyperbolic edge probability

Adds edge attribute _hyperbolic edge probability_ based on
hyperbolic distances between vertices. This indicates
how likely that edge would be to exist if the input graph was
probability x similarity-grown.
On a general level it is a metric of *edge strength*.
Probabilities are guaranteed to be 0 =< p =< 1 .
Vertices must have two _Double_ vertex attributes to be 
used as radial and angular coordinates.

====
[[radial]] Radial::
The vertex attribute to be used as radial coordinates.
Should not contain negative values.

[[angular]] Angular::
The vertex attribute to be used as angular coordinates.
Values should be 0 - 2 * Pi.
