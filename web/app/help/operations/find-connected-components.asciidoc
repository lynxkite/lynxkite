### Find connected components

Creates a segment for every connected component of the graph.

Connected components are maximal vertex sets where a path exists between each pair of vertices.


====
[[name]] Segmentation name::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[[directions]] Edge direction::
Ignore directions:::
The algorithm adds reversed edges before calculating the components.
Require both directions:::
The algorithm discards non-symmetric edges before calculating the components.
