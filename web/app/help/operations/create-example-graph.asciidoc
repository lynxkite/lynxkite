### Create example graph

Creates small test graph with 4 people and 4 edges between them.

====
The vertices and their attributes are:
|===
| name | age | gender | income | location

| Adam | 20.3 | Male | 1000 | _coordinates of New York_
| Eve | 18.2 | Female | _undefined_ | _coordinates of Budapest_
| Bob | 50.3 | Male | 2000 | _coordinates of Singapore_
| Isolated Joe | 2.0 | Male | _undefined_ | _coordinates of Sydney_
|===

The edges and their attributes are:
|===
| src | dst | comment | weight

| Adam | Eve | Adam loves Eve | 1
| Eve | Adam | Eve loves Adam | 2
| Bob | Adam | Bob envies Adam | 3
| Bob | Eve | Bob loves Eve | 4
|===

As silly as this graph is, it is useful for quickly trying a wide range of features.
