### Copy graph into a segmentation

Imports the project as its own segmentation and creates edges between the original
vertices and their corresponding vertices in the segmentation.

For example, to find the PageRank of nodes by ignoring edges with certain properties you
can do a filter and a <<Compute PageRank>> on the imported segmentation and then copy back
the resulting attribute.
