### Define segmentation links from matching attributes

Connect vertices in the base project with segments based on matching attributes.

This operation can be used (among other things) to create connections between two projects once
one has been imported as a segmentation of the other.
(See <<Import project as segmentation>>.)

If segmentation links already exist, use the
<<discard-segmentation-links, Discard segmentation links>> operation to discard links first.

====
[[base-id-attr]] Identifying vertex attribute in base project::
A vertex will be connected to a segment if the selected vertex attribute of the vertex
matches the selected vertex attribute of the segment.

[[seg-id-attr]] Identifying vertex attribute in the segmentation::
A vertex will be connected to a segment if the selected vertex attribute of the vertex
matches the selected vertex attribute of the segment.
