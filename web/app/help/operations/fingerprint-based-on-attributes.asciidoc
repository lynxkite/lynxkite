### Fingerprint based on attributes

In a graph that has two different String identifier attributes (e.g. Facebook ID and
MSISDN) this operation will match the vertices that only have the first attribute defined
with the vertices that only have the second attribute defined. For the well-matched vertices
the new attributes will be added. (For example if a vertex only had an MSISDN and we found a
matching Facebook ID, this will be saved as the Facebook ID of the vertex.)

The matched vertices will not be automatically merged, but this can easily be performed
with the <<Merge vertices by attribute>> operation
on either of the two identifier attributes.

====
The matches are identified by calculating a similarity score between vertices and picking a
matching that ensures a high total similarity score across the matched pairs.

The similarity calculation is based on the network structure: the more alike their neighborhoods
are, the more similar two vertices are considered. Vertex attributes are not considered in the
calculation.

*Parameters*

[p-leftname]#First ID attribute#::
Two identifying attributes have to be selected.

[p-rightname]#Second ID attribute#::
Two identifying attributes have to be selected.

[p-weights]#Edge weights#::
What `number` edge attribute to use as edge weight. The edge weights are also considered when
calculating the similarity between two vertices.

[p-mo]#Minimum overlap#::
The number of common neighbors two vertices must have to be considered for matching.
It must be at least 1. (If two vertices have no common neighbors their similarity would be zero
anyway.)

[p-ms]#Minimum similarity#::
The similarity threshold below which two vertices will not be considered a match even if there are
no better matches for them. Similarity is normalized to [0, 1].

[p-extra]#Fingerprinting algorithm additional parameters#::
You can use this box to further tweak how the fingerprinting operation works. Consult with a Lynx
expert if you think you need this.
