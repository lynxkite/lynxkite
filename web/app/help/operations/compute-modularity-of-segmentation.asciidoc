### Compute modularity of segmentation

Computes a scalar for a non-overlapping segmentation.
If the vertices in this segmentation were connected randomly,
a certain fraction of all edges would fall within each segment.
We subtract this from the observed fraction of edges that fall within
the segments. Modularity is the total observed difference.

A modularity of 0 means the relationship between internal edges and
external edges is consistent with randomly selected edges or segments.
A positive modularity means more internal edges than would be expected
by chance. A negative modularity means less internal edges than would
be expected by chance.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1Modularity.html[NetworKit]
implementation.

====
[p-name]#Save as#::
This box creates a new vertex attribute on the segmentation by this name.

[p-weight]#Edge weight#::
An edge attribute can be used to weight the edges instead of just looking at
edge counts.
