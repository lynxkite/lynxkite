### Compute segment stability

Computes the stability of each segment in a non-overlapping segmentation.
A vertex is considered stable if it has more neighbors inside the
segment than outside. The stability of a segment is the fraction of
its vertices that are stable.

A high stability value (close to 1) indicates a segment where vertices are
more connected internally than externally. A stability lower than 0.5 means
that the majority of neighbors are external for more than half of the vertices.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1StablePartitionNodes.html[NetworKit]
implementation.
