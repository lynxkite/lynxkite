### Copy vertex attributes from segmentation

Copies all vertex attributes from the segmentation to the parent.

This operation is only available when each vertex belongs to just one segment.
(As in the case of connected components, for example.)

====
*Example use case*

You have performed <<link-project-and-segmentation-by-fingerprint>>. At this point there is
a sparse one-to-one connection between the project vertices and the segmentation vertices.
You can use <<copy-vertex-attributes-from-segmentation>> and
<<copy-vertex-attributes-to-segmentation>> to copy all attributes from one side to the other.

*Parameters*

[[prefix]] Attribute name prefix::
A prefix for the new attribute names. Leave empty for no prefix.
