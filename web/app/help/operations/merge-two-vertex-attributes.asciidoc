### Merge two vertex attributes

An attribute may not be defined on every vertex. This operation uses the secondary
attribute to fill in the values where the primary attribute is undefined. If both are
undefined on a vertex then the result is undefined too.

====
[[name]] New attribute name::
The new attribute will be created under this name.

[[attr1]] Primary attribute::
If this attribute is defined on a vertex, then its value will be copied to the output attribute.

[[attr2]] Secondary attribute::
If the primary attribute is not defined on a vertex but the secondary attribute is, then the
secondary attribute's value will be copied to the output variable.
