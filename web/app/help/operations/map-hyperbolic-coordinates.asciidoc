### Map hyperbolic coordinates

<<experimental-operation,+++<i class="fa fa-warning"></i>+++ *Warning! Experimental operation.*>>

Map an undirected graph to a hyperbolic surface. Vertices get two attributes called
"radial" and "angular" that can be used for edge strength evaluation or link prediction.
The algorithm is based on
https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4384[Network Mapping by Replaying Hyperbolic Growth].

The coordinates are generated by simulating hyperbolic growth. The algorithm's results
are most useful when the graph to be mapped follows a power-law degree distribution
and has high clustering.
