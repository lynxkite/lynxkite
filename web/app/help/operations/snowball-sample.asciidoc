### Create snowball sample

This operation creates a small smart sample of a graph. First, a subset of the original vertices is chosen
for start points; the ratio of the size of this subset to the size of the original vertex set
is the first parameter for the operation.
Then a certain neighborhood of each start point is added to the sample; the radius of this neighborhood
is controlled by another parameter.
The result of the operation is a subgraph of the original graph consisting of the vertices of the sample and
the edges between them.
This operation also creates a new attribute which shows how far the sample vertices are from the
closest start point. (One vertex can be in more than one neighborhood.)
This attribute can be used to decide whether a sample vertex is near to a start point or not.

For example, you can create a random sample of the graph to test your model on smaller data set.
