### Sample edges from co-occurrence

Connects vertices in the parent graph with a given probability
if they co-occur in any segments.
Multiple co-occurrences will have the same chance of being selected
as single ones. Loop edges are also included with the same probability.

====
[p-probability]#Vertex pair selection probability#::
The probability of choosing a vertex pair. The expected value of the number of
created vertices will be _probability * number of edges without parallel edges_.

[p-seed]#Random seed#::
The random seed.
