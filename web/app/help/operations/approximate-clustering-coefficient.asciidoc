### Approximate clustering coefficient

Scalable algorithm to calculate the approximate local
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient[clustering
coefficient] attribute for every vertex. It quantifies how close the
vertex's neighbors are to being a clique. In practice a high (close to
1.0) clustering coefficient means that the neighbors of a vertex are
highly interconnected, 0.0 means there are no edges between the
neighbors of the vertex.

[[name]] Attribute name::
The new attribute will be created under this name.

[[bits]] The precision of the algorithm::
This algorithm is an approximation. This parameter sets the trade-off between
the quality of the approximation and the memory and time consumption of the algorithm.
