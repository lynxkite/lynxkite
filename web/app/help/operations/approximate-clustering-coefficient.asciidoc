### Approximate clustering coefficient

Scalable algorithm to calculate the approximate local

attribute for every vertex. It quantifies how close the
vertex's neighbors are to being a clique. In practice a high (close to
1.0) clustering coefficient means that the neighbors of a vertex are
highly interconnected, 0.0 means there are no edges between the
neighbors of the vertex.

This algorithm is an approximation. This parameter sets the trade-off between
the quality of the approximation and the memory and time consumption of the algorithm.
