### Find communities with the Louvain method

Uses the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method[Louvain method] to identify
communities in the graph. The communities are represented as a segmentation on
the graph.

The Louvain method is a greedy optimization toward maximal _modularity_.
High modularity means many edges within communities and few edges between communities.
Specifically we compare the edge counts to what we would expect if the clusters
were chosen at random.

[p-name]#Save segmentation as#::
The name of the newly created segmentation.

[p-weight]#Weight attribute#::
Edges can be weighted to contribute more or less to modularity.

[p-resolution]#Resolution#::
A lower resolution will result in bigger communities.
+
Also known as the ùõæ parameter, the expected edge probabilities in the modularity
calculation are multiplied by this number.
