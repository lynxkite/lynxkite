### Create edges from co-occurrence

Connects vertices in the parent project if they co-occur in any segments.
Multiple co-occurrences will result in multiple parallel edges. Loop edges
are generated for each segment that a vertex belongs to. The attributes of
the segment are copied to the edges created from it.
