### Create edges from co-occurrence

Connects vertices in the base graph if they co-occur in any segments.
Multiple co-occurrences will result in multiple parallel edges. Loop edges
are generated for each segment that a vertex belongs to. The attributes of
the segment are copied to the edges created from it.

After opening this operation from the toolbox, you will be shown the number of edges
that will be created.

Co-occurrence has a potential to create a very large number of edges.
If the predicted number is too high, try to eliminate very large
segments before running the operation!
