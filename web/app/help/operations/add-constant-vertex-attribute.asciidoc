### Add constant vertex attribute

Adds an attribute with a fixed value to every vertex.

====
*Example use case*

Create a constant vertex attribute with value 'A' in graph A.
Then, create a constant vertex attribute with value 'B' in graph B. Use the same
attribute name in both cases. From then on, if a union graph is created from these two graphs,
the vertex attribute will tell which graph the vertex originally belonged to.

*Parameters*

[p-name]#Attribute name#::
The new attribute will be created under this name.

[p-value]#Value#::
The attribute value. Should be a number if _Type_ is set to `number`.

[p-type]#Type#::
The operation can create either `number` or `String` typed attributes.
