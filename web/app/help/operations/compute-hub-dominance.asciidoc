### Compute hub dominance

Computes the hub dominance metric for each segment in a segmentation.
The hub dominance of a segment is the highest internal degree in the segment
divided by the highest _possible_ internal degree. (The segment size minus one.)

If a segment has a vertex that is connected to all other vertices in that segment
then its hub dominance will be 1. This metric is useful for comparing the structures
that make up the different segments in a segmentation.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1CoverHubDominance.html[NetworKit]
implementation.
