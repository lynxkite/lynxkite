### Compute segment conductance

Computes the conductance of each segment in a non-overlapping segmentation.
The conductance of a segment is the number of edges going between the segment
and the rest of the graph divided by sum of the degrees in the segment or the rest
of the graph (whichever is smaller).

A high conductance value indicates a segment that is strongly connected to the rest
of the graph. A value over 0.5 means more edges going out of the segment than
edges inside it.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2143[Experiments on Density-Constrained Graph Clustering]
by GÃ¶rke et al for details and analysis.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1IsolatedInterpartitionConductance.html[NetworKit]
implementation.

====
[p-name]#Save as#::
This box creates a new vertex attribute on the segmentation by this name.

[p-weight]#Edge weight#::
The definition can be rephrased to apply to weighted graphs. In this case
the total weight of the cut is compared to the weighted degrees.
