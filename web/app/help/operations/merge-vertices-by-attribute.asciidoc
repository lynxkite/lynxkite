### Merge vertices by attribute

Merges each set of vertices that are equal by the chosen attribute. Vertices where the chosen
attribute is not defined are discarded. Aggregations can be specified for how to handle the rest of
the attributes, which may be different among the merged vertices. Any edge that connected two
vertices that are merged will become a loop.

Merge vertices by attributes might create parallel links between the base graph
and its segmentations. If it is important that there are no such parallel links
(e.g. when performing aggregations to and from segmentations),
make sure to run the <<merge-parallel-segmentation-links, Merge parallel segmentation links>>
operation on the segmentations in question.
====
*Example use case*

You merge phone numbers that have the same IMEI; each vertex then
represents one mobile device. You can aggregate one attribute as `count` to have an attribute that
represents the number of phone numbers merged into one vertex.

*Parameters*

[p-key]#Match by#::
If a set of vertices have the same value for the selected attribute, they will all be merged
into a single vertex.
