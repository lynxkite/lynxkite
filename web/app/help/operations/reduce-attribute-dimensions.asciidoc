### Reduce attribute dimensions

Transforms (embeds) a `Vector` attribute to a lower-dimensional space.
This is great for laying out graphs for visualizations based on vertex attributes
rather than graph structure.

====
[p-save_as]#Save embeding as#::
The new attribute will be created under this name.

[p-vector]#High-dimensional vector#::
The high-dimensional vertex attribute that we want to embed.

[p-dimensions]#Dimensions#::
Number of dimensions in the output vector. A `(number, number)` coordinate
pair is output for 2 dimensions, which can be visualized as a position.

[p-method]#Embedding method#::
The dimensionality reduction method to use.

[p-perplexity]#Perplexity#::
Size of the vertex neighborhood to consider for t-SNE.
