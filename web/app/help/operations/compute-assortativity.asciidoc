### Compute assortativity

Assortativity is the correlation in the values of an attribute
along the edges of the graph. A high assortativity means connected vertices
often have similar attribute values.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1Assortativity.html[NetworKit] implementation.
