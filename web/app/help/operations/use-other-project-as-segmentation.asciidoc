### Use other project as segmentation

Copies another project into a new segmentation for this one. There will be no
connections between the segments and the base vertices. You can import/create those via
other operations (see <<Use table as segmentation links>> and
<<Define segmentation links from matching attributes>>).

Note that it is possible to import the project itself as segmentation. But even in this
special case, there will be no connections between the segments and the base vertices.
Another operation, <<Use base project as segmentation>> can be used to overcome this limitation.
