### Use other project as segmentation

Copies another project into a new segmentation for this one. There will be no
connections between the segments and the base vertices. You can import/create those via
other operations. (See <<Use table as segmentation links>> and
<<Define segmentation links from matching attributes>>.)

It is possible to import the project itself as segmentation. But even in this
special case, there will be no connections between the segments and the base vertices.
Another operation, <<Use base project as segmentation>> can be used if edges are desired.
