### Find k-core decomposition

If we deleted all parts of a graph outside of the __k__-core, all vertices would
still have a degree of at least _k_. More visually, the 0-core is the whole graph.
If we discard the isolated vertices we get the 1-core. If we repeatedly discard
all degree-1 vertices, we get the 2-core. And so on.

This operation outputs the number of the highest core that each vertex belongs to
as a vertex attribute.
