### Compute degree

For every vertex, this operation calculates either the number of edges it is connected to
or the number of neighboring vertices it is connected to.
You can use the `Count` parameter to control this calculation:
choosing one of the 'edges' settings can result in a neighboring
vertex being counted several times (depending on the number of edges between
the vertex and the neighboring vertex); whereas choosing one of the 'neighbors' settings
will result in each neighboring vertex counted once.

 - `incoming edges`: Count the edges coming in to each vertex.
 - `outgoing edges`: Count the edges going out of each vertex.
 - `all edges`: Count all the edges going in or out of each vertex.
 - `symmetric edges`:
   Count the 'symmetric' edges for each vertex: this means that if you have n edges
   going from A to B and k edges going from B to A, then min(n,k) edges will be
   taken into account for both A and B.
 - `in-neighbors`: For each vertex A, count those vertices
   that have an outgoing edge to A.
 - `out-neighbors`: For each vertex A, count those vertices
   that have an incoming edge from A.
 - `all neighbors`: For each vertex A, count those vertices
   that either have an outgoing edge to or an incoming edge from A.
 - `symmetric neighbors`: For each vertex A, count those vertices
   that have both an outgoing edge to and an incoming edge from A.
