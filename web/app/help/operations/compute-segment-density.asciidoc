### Compute segment density

Computes the density of each segment in a non-overlapping segmentation.
The density of a segment is the number of internal edges divided by the
number of possible internal edges.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1IntrapartitionDensity.html[NetworKit]
implementation.
