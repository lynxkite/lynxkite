### Derive edge attribute

Generates a new attribute based on existing attributes. The value expression can be
an arbitrary Scala expression, and it can refer to existing attributes on the edge as if
they were local variables. It can also refer to attributes of the source and destination
vertex of the edge using the format `src$attribute` and `dst$attribute`.

For example you can write `weight * scala.math.abs(src$age - dst$age)` to generate a new
attribute that is the weighted age difference of the two endpoints of the edge.

You can also refer to graph attributes in the Scala expression. For example,
assuming that you have a graph attribute _age_average_, you can use the expression
`if (src$age < age_average / 2 && dst$age > age_average * 2) 1.0 else 0.0`
to identify connections between relatively young and relatively old people.

Back quotes can be used to refer to attribute names that are not valid Scala identifiers.

The Scala expression can return any of the following types:
- `String`,
- `Double`, which will be presented as `number`
- `Int`, which will be automatically converted to `Double`
- `Long`, which will be automatically converted to `Double`
- `Vector`s or `Set`s combined from the above.

In case you do not want to define the output for every input, you can return an `Option`
created from the above types. E.g. `if (income > 1000) Some(age) else None`.

====
[p-output]#Save as#::
The new attribute will be created under this name.

[p-defined_attrs]#Only run on defined attributes#::
- `true`: The new attribute will only be defined on edges for which all the attributes used in the
  expression are defined.
- `false`: The new attribute is defined on all edges. In this case the Scala expression does not
  pass the attributes using their original types, but wraps them into `Option`s. E.g. if you have
  an attribute `income: Double` you would see it as `income: Option[Double]` making
  `income.getOrElse(0.0)` a valid expression.

[p-expr]#Value#::
The Scala expression. You can enter multiple lines in the editor.

[p-persist]#Persist result#::
If enabled, the output attribute will be saved to disk once it is calculated. If disabled, the
attribute will be re-computed each time its output is used. Persistence can improve performance
at the cost of disk space.
