### Create Erdős–Rényi graph

Creates a random graph using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model[Erdős–Rényi model].
In this model each pair of vertices is connected independently with the same probability.
It creates a very uniform graph with no tendency to skewed degree distributions or clustering.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1ErdosRenyiGenerator.html[NetworKit] implementation.

====
[p-size]#Number of vertices#::
The created graph will have this many vertices.

[p-probability]#Edge probability#::
Each pair of vertices is connected with this probability.

[p-seed]#Seed#::
The random seed.
