### Segment by event sequence

Treat vertices as people attending events, and segment them by attendance of sequences of events.
There are several algorithms for generating event sequences, see under
<<segment-by-event-sequence-algorithm, Algorithm>>.

This operation runs on a segmentation which contains events as vertices, and it is a segmentation
over a graph containing people as vertices.

====
[p-name]#segmentation name#::
The new segmentation will be saved under this name.

[p-time_attr]#Time attribute#::
The `number` attribute corresponding the time of events.

[p-location]#Location#::
A segmentation over events or an attribute corresponding to the location of events.

[p-algorithm]#Algorithm#::
* *Take continuous event sequences*:
Merges subsequent events of the same location, and then takes all the continuous event sequences
of length _Time window length_, with maximal timespan of _Time window length_. For each of these
events, a segment is created for each time bucket the starting event falls into. Time buckets
are defined by _Time window step_ and bucketing starts from 0.0 time.

* *Allow gaps in event sequences:*
Takes all event sequences that are no longer than _Time window length_ and then creates a segment
for each subsequence with _Sequence length_.

[p-sequence_length]#Sequence length#::
Number of events in each segment.

[p-time_window_step]#Time window step#::
Bucket size used for discretizing events.

[p-time_window_length]#Time window length#::
Maximum time difference between first and last event in a segment.
