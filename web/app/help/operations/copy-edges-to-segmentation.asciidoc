### Copy edges to segmentation

Copies the edges from the base graph to the segmentation. The copy is performed along the links
between the base graph and the segmentation. If a base vertex belongs to no segments, its edges
will not be found in the result. If a base vertex belongs to multiple segments, its edges will
have multiple copies in the result.
