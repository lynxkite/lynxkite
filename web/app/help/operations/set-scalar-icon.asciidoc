### Set scalar icon

Associates an icon with a scalar. It has no effect beyond highlighting something on the user
interface.

The icons are a subset of the Unicode characters in the "emoji" range, as provided by the
https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/[Google Noto Font].

This operation is more easily accessed from the scalar's dropdown menu in the project view.

====
[[name]] Scalar::
The scalar to highlight.

[[icon]] Icon::
One of the supported icon names, such as `snowman_without_snow`. Leave empty to _remove_ the icon.
