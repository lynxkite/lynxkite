### Create edges from set overlaps

Connects segments with large enough overlaps.

====
*Example use case*

Communities are generated as a set of vertices, with no edges between them. But you
may be interested in looking for some structure there, to see which
communities are connected to others. You can generate edges between
the communities by looking at how many vertices of the base graph they have in common.

*Parameters*

[p-minoverlap]#Minimal overlap for connecting two segments#::
Two segments will be connected if they have at least this many members in common.
