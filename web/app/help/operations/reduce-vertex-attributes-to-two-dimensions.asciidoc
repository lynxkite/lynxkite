### Reduce vertex attributes to two dimensions 

Transforms multiple Double attributes to a two-dimensional space (two Double attributes) by
Principal Component Analysis. A pre-scaling on mean and standard deviation is performed.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to emphsize variation and bring out strong patterns in 
a dataset. It often makes data easy to explore and visualize.
