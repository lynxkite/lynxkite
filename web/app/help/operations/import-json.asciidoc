### Import JSON

JSON is a rich human-readable data format. JSON files are larger than CSV files but can represent
data types. Each line of the file in this format stores one record encoded as a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON[JSON] object.

====
[[last_settings]] The settings are ..::
Operations which import data from external source are executed only when the _Run import_ button
is clicked. This field makes it easy to see if the settings are in sync with
the output of the box.

[[filename]] File::
Upload a file by clicking the
+++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud-upload"></i></label>+++ button
or specify a path explicitly. Wildcard (`+foo/*.json+`) and glob (`+foo/{bar,baz}.json+`) patterns
are accepted. See <<prefixed-paths>> for more details on specifying paths.
