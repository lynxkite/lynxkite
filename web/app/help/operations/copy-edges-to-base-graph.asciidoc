Copies the edges from a segmentation to the base graph. The copy is performed along the links
between the the segmentation and the base graph. If two segments are connected with some
edges, then each edge will be copied to each pairs of members of the segments.

After opening this operation from the toolbox, you will be shown the number of edges
that will be created.

This operation has a potential to create a very large number of edges.
If the predicted number is too high, try to eliminate very large
segments or filter the edges of the segmentation before running it!
