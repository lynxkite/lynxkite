### Take edges as vertices

Takes a graph and creates a new one where the vertices correspond to the original graph's
edges. All edge attributes in the original graph are converted to vertex attributes in the new
graph with the `edge_` prefix. All vertex attributes are converted to two vertex attributes with
`src_` and `dst_` prefixes. Scalars and segmentations of the original graph are lost.
