### Use metagraph as graph

Loads the relationships between LynxKite entities such as attributes and operations as a graph.
This complex graph can be useful for debugging or demonstration purposes. Because it exposes
data about all graphs, it is only accessible to administrator users.

====
[p-timestamp]#Current timestamp#::
This number will be used to identify the current state of the metagraph. If you edit the history
and leave the timestamp unchanged, you will get the same metagraph as before. If you change the
timestamp, you will get the latest version of the metagraph.
