### Add reversed edges

For every A{to}B edge adds a new B{to}A edge, copying over the attributes of the original.
Thus this operation will double the number of edges in the graph.

Using this operation you end up with a graph with symmetric edges: if A{to}B exists then
B{to}A also exists. This is the closest you can get to an "undirected" graph.

Optionally, a new edge attribute (a 'distinguishing attribute') will be created so that you can
tell the original edges from the new edges after the operation. Edges where this attribute is 0
are original edges; edges where this attribute is 1 are new edges.

The name of the distinguishing edge attribute; leave it empty if the attribute should not be created.
