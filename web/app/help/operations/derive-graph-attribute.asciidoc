### Derive graph attribute

Generates a new <<graph-attributes, graph attribute>> based on existing graph attributes.
The value expression can be an arbitrary Scala expression, and it can refer to existing
graph attributes as if they were local variables.

For example you could derive a new graph attribute as `something_sum / something_count` to get the average
of something.
