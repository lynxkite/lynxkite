### Compute segment fragmentation

Computes the fragmentation of each segment in a non-overlapping segmentation.
The fragmentation of a segment is one minus the ratio of the size of its largest
component and the whole segment.

A segment that is entirely connected will have a fragmentation of zero.
If the fragmentation approaches one, it will be made up of smaller and
smaller components.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1PartitionFragmentation.html[NetworKit]
implementation.
