### Compute clustering coefficient

Calculates the local
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient[clustering coefficient]
attribute for every vertex. It quantifies how close the
vertex's neighbors are to being a clique. In practice a high (close to
1.0) clustering coefficient means that the neighbors of a vertex are
highly interconnected, 0.0 means there are no edges between the
neighbors of the vertex.
