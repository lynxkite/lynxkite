### Create Barabási–Albert graph

Creates a random graph using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model[Barabási–Albert model].
The vertices are created one by one and connected to a set number of randomly chosen
previously created vertices. This ensures a skewed degree distribution with "older" vertices
tending to have a higher degree.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1BarabasiAlbertGenerator.html[NetworKit] implementation.

====
[p-size]#Number of vertices#::
The created graph will have this many vertices.

[p-attachments_per_vertex]#Attachments per vertex#::
As each vertex is added, it will be connected to this many existing vertices.

[p-connected_at_start]#Nodes connected at the start#::
This many vertices will be connected in a circle at the start of the algorithm.

[p-seed]#Seed#::
The random seed.
