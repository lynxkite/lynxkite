### Set edge attribute icon

Associates an icon with an edge attribute. It has no effect beyond highlighting something on the
user interface.

The icons are a subset of the Unicode characters in the "emoji" range, as provided by the
https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/[Google Noto Font].

This operation is more easily accessed from the attribute's dropdown menu in the project view.
