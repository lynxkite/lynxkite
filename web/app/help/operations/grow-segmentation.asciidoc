### Grow segmentation

Grows the segmentation along edges of the parent graph.

This operation modifies this segmentation by growing each segment with the neighbors of its elements.
For example if vertex A is a member of segment X and edge A{to}B exists in the original graph
then B also becomes the member of X (depending on the value of the direction parameter).

This operation can be used together with <<Use base project as segmentation>> to create a
segmentation of neighborhoods.

[[direction]] Direction::
Adds the neighbors to the segments using this direction.
