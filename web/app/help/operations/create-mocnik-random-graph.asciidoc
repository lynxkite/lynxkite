### Create Mocnik random graph

Creates a random graph as described in
https://www.mocnik-science.net/publications/2015c%20-%20Franz-Benjamin%20Mocnik%20-%20Modelling%20Spatial%20Structures.pdf[Modelling Spatial Structures] by Mocnik et al.
The model is based on randomly placing the vertices in Euclidean space
and generating edges with a higher probability for pairs of vertices
that are closer together.

Uses the https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/cpp_api/classNetworKit_1_1MocnikGenerator.html[NetworKit] implementation.

====
[p-size]#Number of vertices#::
The created graph will have this many vertices.

[p-dimension]#Dimension of space#::
The vertices are placed randomly in a space with this many dimensions.

[p-density]#Density of graph#::
The desired ratio of edges to nodes.

[p-seed]#Seed#::
The random seed.
