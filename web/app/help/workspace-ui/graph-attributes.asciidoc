## Graph attributes

Graph attributes -- also often referred to as scalars -- show data that correspond to the
whole graph.

For example, you can compute the average of any numeric vertex attribute and then this average will
show up as a graph attribute.

It can also show files exported by the user which will have a link to download the file.
