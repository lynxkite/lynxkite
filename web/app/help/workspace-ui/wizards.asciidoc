## Authoring wizards

You can build complex analysis workflows in LynxKite workspaces. You can encapsulate such
workflows in <<custom-boxes>> so that other LynxKite users can reuse them.
Another way to share your work is in the form of _wizards_.

To turn a workspace into a wizard, open the parameters of the <<anchor, Anchor box>>
and set the **Wizard** parameter to _yes_. Now your workspace is a wizard. But it doesn't
have any steps yet.

Each step in a wizard corresponds to a parameter or state popup from the workspace.
There are two ways to add steps to the wizard. The anchor box has a table of steps:

In this table you can specify:

- The **title** of the step. This appears on the wizard view in a large font.
- The **description** of the step. This is a multi-line field where you can add more
  text to the step using https://commonmark.org/help/[Markdown syntax]. This
  makes it possible to use formatted text with images and links.
- The **box** from which you want to use the parameter or output state.
- The **popup** column lets you choose _"parameters"_ (to use the parameter popup) or
  one of the output states of the box.
- The order of the steps using the buttons on the right. Press 
  +++<span class="icon glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></span>+++ or
  +++<span class="icon glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span>+++ to move the step up or down, or
  +++<span class="icon glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span>+++ to delete the step.

You can also quickly add steps to a wizard from a parameter or state popup.
Once the workspace is configured as a wizard, each popup will have a
+++<span class="icon glyphicon glyphicon-gift"></span>+++ icon in the header bar.
Click this icon to add or remove the popup as a step.

Using <<custom-boxes, custom boxes>> as steps in a wizard makes it possible to create
interfaces specially crafted for a specific use case.

### Using wizards

Once a workspace has been configured as a wizard, clicking it in the workspace browser
takes you to the wizard view.

If the **In progress** setting is disabled in the Anchor box, opening the wizard creates a copy
of it. This way multiple users can work off of the same wizard without interfering with each
other. The copies will be created with the **In progress** setting enabled. Opening these
copies then will not create further copies.

See our section on <<wizards-in-directory, Wizards in the workspace browser>> for more
about how wizards look from outside of the workspace.
