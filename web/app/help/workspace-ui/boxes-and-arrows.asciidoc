## Boxes and arrows

Workspaces allow users to describe complex computation flows visually by creating workflows represented by boxes and arrows. How it works: boxes represent operations and they are connected by arrows. Basically it shows the sequence of the operations that are applied to  the data, on a path determined by the arrows.

After creating a new workspace the viewport is empty, besides the <<Anchor>> located in the left corner. The anchor can be used to explain the overall purpose of the workspace. You can add a description, an image and set parameters (more details: <<Parametric parameters>>). The URL to an image is useful when you want to reuse the workflow as a custom box in another workspace: in that case the image will serve as the custom box's icon. Preferably this should be a link to a local image, like `/images/icons/anchor.png`

You can add boxes to the viewport by selecting an operation from <<The operation toolbox>>. Clicking on the box opens its <<Box parameters popup>>, which allows you to set the parameters.

A box can have:

* One or more input
* One or more output

Please note that some boxes don't have inputs (for example: <<Create example graph>>) or outputs (for example: <<Export to CSV>>). A box will indicate the number of boxes that can be connected to it and the type of the required input or output (for example: project, table).

You can add arrows to the viewport by connecting the boxes. Boxes can be connected two ways:

* Automatically, by hovering the input of one box over the output of another
* Manually, by clicking on the output of one box, then dragging the arrow to the input of another

When two boxes are connected, the computation of the selected operation starts. The color of the output will indicate the status:

* Red: error, something's wrong
* Blue: not yet computed
* Yellow: currently computing
* Green: computed

Clicking on the output of a box will open <<State popups>>.
