## Custom boxes

It is easy to extend LynxKite with custom boxes that are specific to a project or organization.
Wrapping logical parts of your workspaces in custom boxes makes the workspace easier to understand
and avoids repetition.

A custom box is simply another workspace. If you place a workspace in the `X/Y/custom_boxes`
directory, you will be able to use it as a custom box in any workspaces recursively under `X/Y`.
If you place a workspace in the top-level `custom_boxes` directory, any workspace in this LynxKite
instance will be able to use it. This system of scoping makes it possible to organize
project-specific or universally useful custom boxes.

If you place a workspace in `custom_boxes`, it will appear in the box catalog under the
_"Custom boxes"_ category, and in the box search. You can place it in a workspace.

A usual workspace used this way will result in a custom box that has no inputs and outputs.
That is not very useful! To fix that, just add <<input>> and <<output>> boxes to the workspace
of the custom box.

It is inconvenient to work with <<input>> boxes, because their output is missing. It will be
filled in when the custom box is used in another workspace. But when you're editing the workspace
of the custom box directly, there is nothing coming in yet. There are two solutions to this:

- Place your custom box in a workspace. Connect its inputs. Select it and dive into the custom box
with the +++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="fas fa-level-down-alt"></i></label>+++ button.
Now you will see and edit the workspace of the custom box in the context of the parent workspace.
The input box will have a valid output: the state that is coming in from the parent workspace.
+
Any changes you make will affect all instances of the custom box.

- It is often the case that your workspace grows and you reach a point where you want to extract
part of it into a custom box. Do not create a workspace in `custom_boxes` manually in this case.
It is simpler to select the part of the workspace that you want to wrap into a custom box and click
the +++<label class="btn btn-default"><i class="fas fa-hat-cowboy"></i></label>+++
_Save selection as custom box_ button instead.
+
The workspaces of custom boxes created this way will automatically have the input and output boxes
set up.

### Custom box parameters

Your custom box now has inputs and outputs and can provide useful functionality. Custom boxes can
also take parameters. This is configured through the <<anchor>> box of the workspace of the custom
box.

You can set the name, type, and default value of the parameters. The following parameter types are
supported:

- **Text:** Anything that the user can type. It could be a string or a number. This will appear as
  a plain input box in the custom box's parameters popup.
- **Boolean:** Will appear as a true/false dropdown selection in the box parameters popup.
- **Code:** Will appear as a multi-line code editor to the user.
- **Choice:** Will appear as a dropdown list. List the offered options after the default value,
  separated by a comma.
- **Vertex attribute, edge attribute, graph attribute, segmentation, column:** These types allow the user to
  select an attribute, segmentation, or column of the input via a dropdown list. If the
  custom box has multiple inputs, the options belonging to all the inputs will be offered in the
  list.

To make use of the custom box's parameters in the workspace of the custom box, you need to access
them from <<parametric-parameters>>. Regardless of their type, all the parameters are seen as
Strings from the Scala code of the parametric parameters. Use `.toInt`, `.toDouble`, `.toBoolean`
on them if you need to do more than simple string substitution.
