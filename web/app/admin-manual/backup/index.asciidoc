# LynxKite backup

## Making backup

If LynxKite was started with `KITE_DATA_DIR` pointing to an S3 bucket, then there is
an easy way to backup all the project information and computed data. For admin users
there is an `S3 backup` menu entry in the `Settings` menu.

## Backup configuration

This `S3 backup` function is only usable, when LynxKite was started
with proper AWS credentials, and the environment variables `KITE_DATA_DIR` and
`KITE_EPHEMERAL_DATA_DIR` are set according to the admin manual.

A typical configuration may look like this:

        KITE_DATA_DIR=s3://bucket_name/
        KITE_EPHEMERAL_DATA_DIR=hdfs://hostname:port/hdfs/location/

The `S3 backup` copies the data from `KITE_EPHEMERAL_DATA_DIR` to `KITE_DATA_DIR` and
also copies LynxKite metadata to a subdirectory of `KITE_DATA_DIR/metadata_backup/`.
The subdirectory named as the current timestamp at the time of the backup.

The location of this metadata backup may look like this:

        s3://bucket_name/metadata_backup/VERSION/

VERSION is a timestamp in the form `YYYYMMddHHmmss`.

## Reusing saved data

When someone restores saved metadata with `emr_ecosystem.py`,
the version with the latest timestamp will be loaded by default,
and earlier versions can be chosen by an optional parameter.

The easiest way to reuse saved data is to start a new cluster using
`emr_ecosystem.py`:

        ./emr_ecosystem.py --s3_data_dir s://bucket-name/ --restore_metadata
