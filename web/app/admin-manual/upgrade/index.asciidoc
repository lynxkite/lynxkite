# Upgrade

## Install new binaries

Just untar the tarball given by your Lynx Analytics contact, preferably to the same location
as you have your previous version. The newly created files/directories will not collide with
already installed binaries.

## Install new Spark version if needed

You can download the Spark version matching your Hadoop setup from the
https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html[Spark webpage]. Your Lynx contact can tell you which
version you need, or you can find it in the file `kite_x.y.z/conf/SPARK_VERSION`.
Another option is to run `kite_x.y.z/tools/install_spark.sh`: this script will set up
the proper kite version.

## Create backups

Make a backup copy of your `.kiterc` file and metadata directory. The location of the metadata
directory is configured in `.kiterc`. If your system is configured to perform automated backups
of `.kiterc` and the metadata directory you may skip this step.

## Update configuration

You need to upgrade your `.kiterc` file to reflect changed and new configuration options.
All these changes are listed in the release notes, but you can in most cases perform this
update via a 3-way merge of the old configuration template, the new configuration template
and your existing config file. Assume your old LynxKite base directory is `kite_OLD`, your new
LynxKite base directory is `kite_NEW` and your current config file is `.kiterc`. Then you can
update the configuration via the following steps:

- Backup your current config file: `cp .kiterc .kiterc.old`
- Perform an automatic 3-way merge (you might need to install the `rcs` package to have the merge
  command available): `merge .kiterc kite_OLD/conf/kiterc_template kite_NEW/conf/kiterc_template`.
- Review the new version of `.kiterc`. Look for merge conflicts (blocks surrounded by `<<<<<<<`
  and `>>>>>>>`). Make sure you understand all options and their values. Please contact the Lynx
  support team if you have any questions or doubt.

## Stop currently running LynxKite version

Use the command `kite-x.y.z/bin/lynxkite stop` where `x.y.z` is the version of your _original_ LynxKite.

## Run the new version of LynxKite

Start the new version of LynxKite with `kite-x.y.z/bin/lynxkite start`, where `x.y.z` is the version
of your _new_ LynxKite. Note that the migration can take several minutes when the upgraded
LynxKite is started for the first time.

## Restore original LynxKite

If anything goes wrong and the new version does not work, you can always go back by

- Stopping the new version of LynxKite
- Restoring the original metadata directory and `.kiterc` file
- Starting the old version of LynxKite
