## Logging

LynxKite logs various activities. The log directory can be configured in
<<kiterc-logging,the .kiterc file>>.

### The application log

The main log of LynxKite is the application log. LynxKite creates a new log file every day (except
for those days when it is not used). It automatically deletes the log files older than 60 days.

The application logs the following activities (among other things):

- User login attempts, successful logins and logouts.
- All HTTP requests received by the web server including the user and the URL.
- Accesses of files in the `KITE_DATA_DIR`.

Admin users can browse and download these logs using the *<LynxKite_URL>/#/logs* URL.

### STDERR and STDOUT

Every time LynxKite is started a log is created for STDERR and STDOUT with the process ID of the
application. These logs generally do not contain much information unless something went wrong
during the startup process.
