## Installing the LynxKite binaries

The LynxKite archive file is *lynxkite-<version_number>.tar*. Unpack this file to any
convenient directory with the command  `tar xf kite_<version_number>.tar`. This
creates a directory *lynxkite-<version_number>*. Make sure that you do this unpacking
on the target Lunux platform. Unpacking on Windows then copying is known to cause problems.

LynxKite needs a copy of a pre-built Apache Spark in the home directory. You can use
the command `tools/install_spark.sh` to download and install it.
