## Configuring LynxKite

### The `.kiterc` file

You need to create a site configuration to be able to run LynxKite. If you don’t have a config file
created yet, running the runner script will warn you and point you to a template config file. Just
copy that template to your home directory with name `.kiterc` and edit the settings as necessary.
The settings are documented inside the template file and in the <<kiterc-file>> section. This
information is also available in the template file as comments.

### Configure directories

This is a best practices section on how to configure various directories properly. The default
configuration provided by Hadoop may be suboptimal.

- DataNode directories should be on a large drive. Set `dfs.data.dir` and `dfs.datanode.data.dir`
  on every DataNode accordingly.
- NameNode and DataNode directories are better to not exist or at least be empty before you start
  the HDFS service the first time / deploy a new node. Check `dfs.name.dir`,
  `dfs.namenode.name.dir`, `dfs.data.dir` and `dfs.datanode.data.dir`.
- Datanode directories have to be owned by `hdfs:hadoop`.
- YARN log dirs should be on a large drive. Check `yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs` and `hadoop.log.dir`
  in the NodeManager and `hadoop.log.dir` in the ResourceManager configuration.
- YARN log dir has to be owned by `yarn:hadoop`
- Set the `yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs` (YARN app cache and file cache) to be on the appropriate
  drive. It should be sufficiently large (typically at least 100GB).
- Make sure that you have properly configured prefixes if you need them as described in the
  <<prefix-definitions>> section.

### Running LynxKite

LynxKite can be started with its runner script (e.g., `run-kite-stable.sh`). You can use the
`start` / `stop` / `restart` commands if you want to run it as a daemon. Or, you can use the
interactive command which starts up the program tied to your current shell session, so its output
will appear in the shell and pressing Ctrl-C or closing the shell session will terminate the
program.

### User authentication

In the default configuration user authentication is turned off. To enable user authentication,
you have to enable HTTPS (see next section). To securely set up user authentication:

- Make sure LynxKite is not accessible externally.
- Start LynxKite without authentication. Go to http://<lynxkite_url>/#/users and add at
  least one new administrator user. (Administrator users can create more users.)
- Enable HTTPS in the `.kiterc` file.
- Restart LynxKite with authentication. Confirm that user credentials are now required for login.
- You can now make LynxKite externally accessible.

In addition to this, LynxKite can be authenticated using a remote LDAP service. LDAP authenticated
users will always be non-administrators. Regular LynxKite and LDAP user authentication can coexist.
The details of setting up LDAP authentication are specified in the
<<ldap-authentication,LDAP authentication section>> of the `.kiterc` chapter.

### Access control setup

After the users are created, HDFS/Linux directory level access control can be enabled
as explained in <<prefix-based-access-control>>. LynxKite level access control can be managed
directly on the LynxKite Web UI.

### HTTPS setup

To enable HTTPS, a certificate is required. For testing purposes a self-signed certificate is
included (`conf/localhost.self-signed.cert`). Its password is “keystore-password”. This certificate does
not provide proper protection. (Lacking a trusted CA, the self-signed certificate can easily
be spoofed.) Using it will trigger a certificate warning in the user’s browser. It is recommended
to install a real certificate in its place.

Please refer to the <<kiterc-https,HTTPS setup>> in the `.kiterc` file for more details.

### Backups

Once LynxKite is up and running, take a moment to think about backups. The solution is entirely
dependent on the site and purpose of the installation. But consider that LynxKite deals with the
following data:

- *Import/export.*
- *Graph data in `KITE_DATA_DIR`.* The vertices, edges and attributes of the graph. This data
  is stored on a distributed file system. This typically provides resilience against data loss.
- *Project metadata in `KITE_META_DIR`.* The operations that have been executed on the project
  and their parameters. This data is small, and contains everything required to regenerate the
  graph data, assuming that the imported files are still available. This data is critical, and
  backups are recommended.

There is a backup tool for Hadoop deployments shipped with LynxKite under
`tools/kite_meta_hdfs_backup.sh`. It is recommended to create a cron job running this tool on
a daily basis (or more frequently if needed). The tool creates a copy of the full `KITE_META_DIR`
and the `.kiterc` file in HDFS.

To restore an earlier version of LynxKite simply copy the `.kiterc` file and the meta
directory back from HDFS to overwrite the current versions of them, then restart LynxKite.


### Extra libraries

You can provide extra jar files that will be added to the `CLASSPATH` of LynxKite server if needed,
as specified <<kiterc-extra-jars,here>>.

### Integration with Hive

#### Overview
Hive stores the actual data on HDFS (usually under the /user/hive/warehouse directory), while the
metadata (location of the underlying file, schema, ..) of the tables is stored by Hive Metastore.
When Spark wants to import a hive table then it first asks the Hive Metastore for the metadata then
uses this metadata to try to import directly from the underlying files.
This means that for Spark to import a hive table, it needs:

 - to know how to access the Hive Metastore;
 - to have the authorization to access the Hive Metastore;
 - to have the authorization to read the metadata of the table;
 - to have read access for the underlying file on HDFS.

#### Telling Spark how to access the Hive Metastore
The simplest way to do this is to create a symbolic link from the conf directory under the Spark
installation directory LynxKite is using to the hive-site.xml file.
E.g. depending on your Hadoop distribution, something like this would do:

```
ln -s /etc/hive/conf/hive-site.xml ~/spark-<version>/conf/
```

#### Getting authorization to read the metadata of a table
Hive Metastore server supports Kerberos authentication for Thrift clients, so it is possible that
on clusters using Kerberos the access to Hive Metastore is restricted to only a subset of Kerberos
users.

To see if that is the case on your cluster, check the `hadoop.proxyuser.hive.groups` property in
the `core-site.xml` on the Hive Metastore host. If its value is set to *** or it is not set then
that means that there is no restriction on who can acces the Hive Metastore. However, if it
contains a list of groups, then add the group which the user running LynxKite belongs to to the
list.

https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-6-x/topics/cdh_sg_hive_metastore_security.html

If the impersonating concept is not clear from the above articel, then the general idea is better
explained here:
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Superusers.html

#### Getting authorization to read the metadata of given table
Hive offers 3 authorization options:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Authorization

- Storaged Based Authorization in the Metastore Server: this means that the user has the same access right for the metadata as he has for the underlying data on HDFS.
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Storage+Based+Authorization+in+the+Metastore+Server


- SQL Standards Based Authorization: Like in a MySQL database you add privileges to users. https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization


- Default Hive Authorization (Legacy Mode): Uses roles to group grants. These roles then can be assigned to users, groups or to other roles.
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Default+Authorization+-+Legacy+Mode


#### Getting authorization to read the underlying file on HDFS
Please consult with the owner of the cluster to give you read access for all the corresponding files.

#### Known issues

.If in the imported table the values of some columns become all nulls.
Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names and column names. Because of this, Hive
Metastore stores the column names in all lower case. But Parquet files and ORC are case preserving
so If the underlying file doesn’t use this convention, then Spark will try to import data from
non-existing columns and this will result in columns with all nulls.

One exception is the partitioner column - since the partitioner is part of the HDFS path, Hive
Metastore is forced to store it in a case preserving manner.
So if you can change the schema of the underlying files without causing problem then that’s the
fix. If not, then create new tables whose underlying files’ column names are all in lower
case - e.g. you can do this with
```
CREATE TABLE <new_table> AS
    SELECT * FROM <old table>
```
query.

### Integrating with High Availability mode HDFS

LynxKite is compatible with HDFS running in High Availability mode. In this case the HDFS prefixes
i.e. the `KITE_DATA_DIR` variable in <<kiterc-file>> and the <<prefix-definitions>> need to use the
appropriate name service defined in the `hdfs-site.xml` configuration file of Hadoop (e.g.
`hdfs://nameservice1/user/my_user/my_dir`). Make sure that the file is available in the
`YARN_CONF_DIR`. Please refer to the related
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HDFSHighAvailabilityWithNFS.html[Hadoop documentation]
for more details.
