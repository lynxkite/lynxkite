## Automatic log collection

For Internet-connected LynxKite instances, it is possible to set up a cronjob that sends
the logs created by the running instance to LynxAnalytics.
This is useful partly for debugging purposes, partly for
maintaining a database that can answer questions such as how much time does
it usually take to perform this and that operation.

Note that the uploaded logs will be treated confidentiality.

To configure this, locate the file `tools/cron_upload.sh` in the installation.
Suppose that the full path is `/home/kite/kite_1.7.3/tools/cron_upload.sh`.
Then issue the command `crontab -e` and type the following in the editor invoked:
`@daily /home/kite/kite_1.7.3/tools/cron_upload.sh`.
This way uploading will be triggered every day.
It is, of course, possible to create a custom setup; daily upload is just a
recommended setting.  Please make sure that <<kite-instance,`KITE_INSTANCE`>>
is set in `.kiterc`, otherwise log upload will not work.
It is not necessary to repeat this whenever you install a new LynxKite version.
