## LynxKite with Kerberos

LynxKite supports running on Kerberos-secured clusters. To enable this, you will need to set
`KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL` and `KERBEROS_KEYTAB` in your <<kiterc-file,`.kiterc`>> respectively.

The Kerberos configuration (`krb5.conf`) must also be accessible on the machine where LynxKite
is running. If LynxKite is running inside a Docker container, make sure this file is passed in,
for example through a mount. The path to `krb5.conf` can be configured with the `KRB5_CONFIG`
environment variable.

You will need to contact your administrator to obtain the keytab file. In a typical setup, you
could do the following to obtain a Keytab file. Start the `ktutil` shell and then enter:
```
addent -password -p principal_user@PRINCIPAL_DOMAIN -k 1 -e RC4-HMAC
wkt lynx.keytab
exit
```
If you need to access the cluster from command line tools, such as `hadoop`, `hdfs` or `yarn`,
then you may need to run the `kinit` program to obtain a ticket-granting ticket for
these.
