      a CSV file as a bipartite graph is easy in LynxKite.\nYou can look at the workspace

      at the results of\nmodular clustering in bipartite graphs.\n\nYour CSV file
      describes connections\nbetween an \"A\" side and a \"B\" side. It has to have
      two columns\nthat we can use as the \"A\" side IDs and the \"B\" side IDs.\n\nIf
      it has a connection weight column, that's even better!\n\n If you don't have
