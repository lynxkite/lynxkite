def addPopularityXSimilarityOptimizedEdges(externaldegree, internaldegree, exponent, seed):
  '''  Experimental Feature


  Creates a graph with given amount of vertices and average degrees. The edges
  will follow a power-law - also known as scale-free - distribution and have
  high clustering. Vertices get two edge attributes called "radial" and
  "angular" that can later be used for edge strength evaluation or link prediction.
  The algorithm is based on
  `Popularity versus Similarity in Growing Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0286>`_ and
  `Network Mapping by Replaying Hyperbolic Growth <https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4384>`_.


  The edges are generated by simulating hyperbolic growth. Vertices are added
  one by one and at the time of each addition new edges are created in two ways.
  First, the new vertex is added and it creates edges from itself to older vertices
   - "external" edges. Then some new edges are added between older vertices
   - "internal" edges. This way the average amount of edges added per vertex will be slightly more than *externalDegree + internalDegree*.

  :param externaldegree:   The number of edges a vertex creates from itself upon addition to the growing graph.
  :param internaldegree:   The average number of edges created between older vertices whenever a new vertex
     is added to the growing graph.
  :param exponent:   The exponent of the power-law degree distribution. Values can be 0.5 - 1, endpoints excluded.
  :param seed:   The random seed.

  tell the original edges from the new edges after the operation. Edges where this attribute is 0
  are original edges; edges where this attribute is 1 are new edges.

  ----

  `graph_attributes` is an object you can use to get and set graph attributes.

  `vs` (for "**v**ertice**s**") and `es` (for "**e**dge**s**") are both
  `tibbles <https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tibble.html>`_.
  You can write natural R code and use the usual APIs and packages to
  compute new attributes. Dplyr is already imported.
  `es` can have `src` and `dst` columns which are the indexes of the source and destination
  vertex for each edge. These can be used to index into `vs` as in the example.

  Assign the new columns to these same data frames to output new vertex or edge attributes.

  When you write this R code, the input data may not be available yet.
  And you may want to keep building on the output of the box without having
  to wait for the R code to execute. To make this possible, LynxKite has
  to know the inputs and outputs of your code without executing it.
  You specify them through the *Inputs* and *Outputs* parameters.
  For outputs you must also declare their types.

  The currently supported types for outputs are:

  - `double` to create a `number`-typed attribute or `Double`-typed table column.
  - `character` to create a `String`-typed attribute or table column.
  - `integer` to create a `Long`-typed table column.
  - `vector` to create a `Vector[number]`-typed attribute.

  In the first example we would set:

  - Inputs: `vs.name, vs.age, es.weight, es.comment, es.src, es.dst, graph_attributes.greeting`
  - Outputs: `vs.with_title: character, vs.age_squared: double, es.score: double, es.names: character, graph_attributes.hello: character, graph_attributes.average_age: double`

  #### Working with vectors

  Vector-typed attributes are stored as list columns in the `vs` and `es` DataFrames.

  To output a vector-typed attribute, you can create a list column or a matrix:

  [source,r]
  ----
  # Put the age and its double into a vector.
  vs$v <- outer(vs$age, c(1, 2))
  ----

  On the <<Create example graph, example graph>> this would output:

  ----
                 v

  This has the same effect as using a SQL box with

def graphRejoin(attrs, segs, edge):
  '''  This operation allows the user to join (i.e., carry over) attributes from one graph to another one.
  This is only allowed when the target of the join (where the attributes are taken to) and the source
  (where the attributes are taken from) are compatible. Compatibility in this context means that
  the source and the target have a "common ancestor", which makes it possible to perform the join.
  Suppose, for example, that operation <<take-edges-as-vertices>> have been applied, and then some
  new vertex attributes have been computed on the resulting graph. These new vertex
  attributes can now be joined back to the original graph (that was the input for
  <<take-edges-as-vertices>>), because there is a correspondence between the edges of the
  original graph and the vertices that contain the newly computed vertex attributes.

  Conversely, the edges and the vertices of a graph will not be compatible (even
  if the number of edges is the same as the number of vertices), because no such
  correspondence can be established between the edges and the vertices in this case.

  Additionally, it is possible to join segmentations from another graph. This operation
  has an additional requirement (besides compatibility), namely, that both the target of the
  join (the left side) and the source be vertices (and not edges).

  Please, bear it in mind that both attributes and segmentations will overwrite
  the original attributes and segmentations on the right side in case there is
  a name collision.

  When vertex attributes are joined, it is also possible to copy over the edges from
  the source graph (provided that the source graph has edges). In this case, the
  original edges in the target graph are dropped, and the source edges (along with
  their attributes) will take their place.

  values.

  Treat the salt like a password for the data. Choose a long string that the recipient of the data has
  no chance of guessing. (Do not use the name of a person or project.)

  The salt must begin with the prefix `SECRET(` and end with `)`, for example
  `SECRET(qCXoC7l0VYiN8Qp)`. This is important, because LynxKite will replace such strings with
  three asterisks when writing log files. Thus, the salt cannot appear in log files.  Caveat: Please
  note that the salt must still be saved to disk as part of the workspace; only the log files are
  filtered this way.

  To illustrate the mechanics of irreversible hashing and the importance of a good salt string,
  consider the following example. We have a data set of phone calls and we have hashed the phone
  numbers. Arthur gets access to the hashed data and learns or guesses the salt. Arthur can now apply
  the same hashing to the phone number of Guinevere as was used on the original data set and look her
  up in the graph. He can also apply hashing to the phone numbers of all the knights of the round

    Pick a column that is uniformly distributed. Numerical identifiers will give the best performance.
    String (`VARCHAR`) columns are also supported but only work well if they mostly contain letters of

  Use the <<Filter by attributes>> box to discard the part of the graph outside of the sample.

  If the resulting sample is still too large, it can be quickly reduced by keeping only the low index
  nodes and edges. Obtaining a sample with exactly `n` vertices is also possible with the

  . Run this operation. Let us denote the computed vertex attribute by `first_reached` and edge
  attribute by `first_traversed`.

  . Filter the vertices by the rank attribute to keep the only vertex of rank `n`.
  . Aggregate `first_reached` to a graph attribute on the filtered graph (use either *average*, *first*,
  *max*, *min*, or *most*common_ - there is only one vertex in the filtered graph).

  between people (identified by `src` and `dst` IDs) we can import the number of total calls between
  each two people. In this case the operation fails for duplicate attribute values - i.e.
  parallel edges.
  - Import using a normal edge attribute. For example if each edge represents a call and the location
  of the person making the call is an edge attribute (cell tower ID) we can import latitudes and
  longitudes for those towers. Here the tower IDs still have to be unique in the lookup table.

  :param id_attr:   The edge attribute which is used to join with the table's ID column.
  :param id_column:   The ID column name in the table. This should be a String column that uses the values
    of the chosen edge attribute as IDs.
  :param prefix:   Prepend this prefix string to the new edge attribute names. This can be used to avoid
    accidentally overwriting existing attributes.
  :param unique_keys:   Assert that the edge attribute values have to be unique if set true. The values of the
    matching ID column in the table have to be unique in both cases.
  :param if_exists:   If the attribute from the table clashes with an existing attribute of the graph,
    you can select how to handle this:
    - **Merge, prefer the table's version**: Where the table defines new values, those will be used.
      Elsewhere the existing values are kept.
    - **Merge, prefer the graph's version**: Where the edge attribute is already defined, it is left
      unchanged. Elsewhere the value from the table is used.
    - **Merge, report error on conflict**: An assertion is made to ensure that the values in the table
      are identical to the values in the graph on edges where both are defined.
    - **Keep the graph's version**: The data in the table is ignored.
    - **Use the table's version**: The attribute is deleted from the graph and replaced with
      the attribute imported from the table.
    - **Disallow this**: A name conflict is treated as an error.

  This is useful when your table contains edges (e.g., calls) and there is no separate
  table for vertices. This operation makes it possible to load edges and use them
  as a graph. Note that this graph will never have zero-degree vertices.
