Steps to start up demo:
1. Build image using ./build.sh in the parent directory
2. Download these CSV files under the image directory:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kpEhAFozvimh7KTrpiF8blraahIXVn7b/view?usp=sharing
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JG_5MnH_Nzoadw01E9LB6w7boY8pbZK7/view?usp=sharing
(DO NOT PUSH THESE TO THE REPO!)
3. ./image/build.sh
4. ./run.sh

If you want to run in a machine where the github repo is not available, then you will need to:
- Load the image built in step 3 on the host
- Copy run.sh and the dags directory under the same parent directory
- ./run.sh
