# The prefix definitions configuration file is used to specify what file paths users are
# allowed to access using what prefixes. It also serves as a means to provide user access
# control to certain prefixes if desired.

# Special prefixes can be defined here that expand to directories or paths.
# Suppose, for example, that the administrator specifies
# DIR="file:/home/user/kite/" in this file. Then whenever the user references
# DIR$subdir/data.txt (s)he will access the file:/home/users/kite/subdir/data.txt.
# Moreover, there is no other way a user can refer to that file (unless there are
# other prefixes defined here that make this possible).

# Format:

# Lines that begin with a hashmark (#) are comments and ignored.

# Prefix symbols should only contain capital letters, underscore,
# and digits; the first character cannot be a digit.
# The dollar sign is NOT part of the prefix symbol.

# The paths that they define should either be empty, or
# end in an at sign (@) or end in a slash (/).
# The defined paths should always start with a file system specification (e.g. s3n: or file:)
# unless they are empty.
# The quotation marks are not part of the path, but they should still be supplied.

# Local prefixes (the ones starting with file:/) only work on
# single-machine LynxKite installations. On distributed LynxKite installations, you will need
# to use a distributed file system, like HDFS or S3.

# Examples:

# LOCAL1="file:/home/user/old_kite_data/"
# LOCAL2="file:/home/user/old_kite_data2/"
# S3N_OLD_DIR="s3n://key:pwd@old_kite_data/"
# S3N_OLD_DIR2="s3n://key:pwd@"
# EMPTY=""

# A specification of EMPTY such as the one above gives the user
# full access to anything; e.g., they can say
# EMPTY$s3n://key:password@somedir/somefile or EMPTY$file://etc/passwd.


# Prefix symbol endings _READ_ACL and _WRITE_ACL have a special meaning: instead of specifying
# a path, they specify user access privileges for a given prefix. Suppose you have defined the
# following prefix:

# SENSITIVE_DATA="hdfs://sensitive_data/"

# By default, all users are allowed to access files such as SENSITIVE_DATA$secret.csv. This can
# be changed by adding two extra lines to the prefix definition file, for example:

# SENSITIVE_DATA_READ_ACL="*@mycompany.com"
# SENSITIVE_DATA_WRITE_ACL="jack@mycompany.com,jill@mycompany.com"

# This gives read access to all users at mycompany.com and write access to users jack, and jill
# (In general, an access control list is comma-delimited; * (asterisk)
# can be used as a wildcard; * means all logged in users.
# *@lynxanalytics.com, for example, means all users with user names matching that pattern.)

# Note that this implies that you cannot have a prefix symbol that ends in _READ_ACL or _WRITE_ACL
# because that would be interpreted as an access control specification.

# Specifying neither read nor write access for a prefix implies * access; that is, any user can
# read or write files accessed via that prefix. But if you specify either access type, you must
# specify the other access type as well.

# It is important to note that access control checks only the prefixes, but not the files itself. So,
# in such a setting

# ROOT="hdfs://root/"
# SENSITIVE_DATA="hdfs://root/sensitive_data/"
# SENSITIVE_DATA_READ_ACL="*@mycompany.com"
# SENSITIVE_DATA_WRITE_ACL="boss@mycompany.com"

# there is no use in providing read and write access to your sensitive data, because
# although only boss@mycompany.com can write SENSITIVE_DATA$secret.csv, anyone
# can read and write ROOT$sensitive_data/secret.csv, which is the same file.
# So if you use prefix-based access control, make sure that the data protected is not
# accessible via another prefix.
